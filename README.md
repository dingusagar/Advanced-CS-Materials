# Advanced-CS-Materials
A curation of posts, videos etc that aims to shift us from a programmer-who-knows-stuffs to programmer-who-really-knows-stuffs-in-depth. Feel free to raise a PR to include something you think can be a good addition to this list.  This can include anything that is not trival to an average programmer.
